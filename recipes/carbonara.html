    <h1>Tagliatelli Carbonara Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/carbonara.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simple yet decadent, carbonara is a true Roman classic, though its origins prove a point of contention. Some suggest the dish earned global fame in the mid-20th century, as American troops stationed in Rome during the Second World War brought their favourite ration-based meal back to their homeland. A more poetic theory of Carbonara’s etymology states that the dish earned its name from the flecks of pepper woven amongst the pasta, for their close resemblance to coal dust, or polvere di carbone.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>175ml single cream</li>
            <li>2/3 cup parmigiano reggiano</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>75g pancetta</li>
            <li>400g fresh tagliatelle</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the egg yolks into a bowl, add the cream, finely grate in the Parmigiano Reggiano and season with freshly cracked black pepper, then mix well. If you can, use chilled eggs here: cold yolks are easier to separate from the white</li>
            <li>Add the pancetta to a large frying pan and sauté over medium-low heat until browned and crisp, around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook your homemade tagliatelle in a large pan of generously salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes, or until al dente (taste a piece before removing from the water).</li>
            <li>Once cooked, reserve 1/2 a cup of the boiling cooking water, and transfer the pasta to the frying pan with the pancetta. Toss well and then immediately remove the pan from heat - this is crucial as to ensure the eggs do not scramble when introduced.</li>
            <li>Now add the egg, cream and cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to ensure the sauce clings to the pasta and does not settle on the base of the pan. Add the pasta water, adjusting as necessary to obtain a silky smooth sauce that completely coats the pasta. Continue to toss vigorously and stir through with a large pair of tongs.</li>
        </ol>
