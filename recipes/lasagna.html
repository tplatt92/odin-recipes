    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe. </p>
        <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.</p>
        <p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>15oz. ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ellow onion</li>
            <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>3/4 lb. italian sausage</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Lasagna</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 lasagna nodles</li>
            <li>2.5 cups mazzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
            <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>
